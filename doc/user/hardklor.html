<B>Description:</B>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hardkl&ouml;r analyzes high-resolution mass spectra, identifying
protein or peptide isotope distributions and determining the
corresponding monoisotopic masses and charge states.  Hardkl&ouml;r is
specifically designed to handle overlapping isotope distributions in a
single spectrum.  A detailed description of the Hardkl&ouml;r
algorithm is given in</p>

<B>Input:</B>

<UL>

<LI>
&lt;spectra&gt; &ndash; The name of a file from which to parse
high-resolution spectra.  The file may be in MS1, FIXME or FIXME
format.</li>

</UL>

<B>Output:</B>

<p>
The program writes files to the folder <code>crux-output</code> by
default.  The name of the output folder can be set by the user using
the <code>--output-dir</code> option.  The following files will be
created:</p>
<ul>

<li>
<b>hardklor.params.txt</b>: a file containing the name and value of all
parameters/options for the current operation.  Not all parameters in
the file may have been used in the operation.  The resulting file can
be used with the <code>--parameter-file</code> option for other crux
programs.
</li>

<li>
<b>hardklor.mono.txt</b>: a tab-delimited text file containing a list
of peptide or protein isotope distributions, their monoisotopic
masses, charge states, and other helpful information. <b>FIXME: Be
more specific.</b></li>

<li>
<b>hardklor.log.txt</b>: a log file containing a copy of all messages
that were printed to stderr.

</ul>

<B>Options:</B>
<UL>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-output.</li>

<li>
<code>--overwrite &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash;
Replace existing files if true (T) or fail when trying to overwrite a
file if false (F). Default =  F.</li>

<li>
<code>--algorithm &lt;name&gt;</code> &ndash; Choose the algorithm for
analyzing combinations of multiple peptide or protein isotope
distributions. There are five algorithms to choose from:
<ul>
<li>
<code>basic</code> &ndash; Computes all combinatorial possibilities
and returns the combination with the highest score.</li>
<li>
<code>fewest-peptides</code> &ndash; Computes increasing depths of
combinations until the score threshold is exceeded. The smallest
combination exceeding the threshold is returned, preventing
over-fitting of the data.</li>
<li>
<code>fast-fewest-peptides</code> &ndash; Same as
the <code>fewest-peptides</code> algorithm, but trades memory usage
for speed. Use this method if there is sufficient memory on the
system.</li>
<li>
<code>fewest-peptides-choice</code> &ndash; Same as
the <code>fewest-peptides</code> algorithm, but adds a heuristic to
evaluate if further combinatorial analysis would produce a better
score. This method can dramatically improve speed, but may not be as
accurate.</li>
<li>
<code>fast-fewest-peptides-choice</code> &ndash; Same as the
<code>fewest-peptides-choice</code> algorithm, but trades memory usage
for speed. Use this method if there is sufficient memory on the
system.</li>
</ul>
The default setting is Basic.</li>

<li>
<code>--cdm B|F|P|Q|S</code> &ndash; Choose the charge state
determination method. There are five methods to choose from:
<ul>
<li>
<code>B</code> &ndash; Basic method, assume all charge states are
possible.</li>
<li>
<code>F</code> &ndash; Fast Fourier transform.</li>
<li>
<code>P</code> &ndash; Patterson algorithm.</li>
<li>
<code>Q</code> &ndash; QuickCharge method, uses inverse peak
distances.</li>
<li>
<code>S</code> &ndash; Senko method, or combined Fast Fourier
Transform and Patterson algorithm.</li>
</ul>
The default setting is B.</li>

<li>
<code>--min-charge &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the minimum charge
state to look for when analyzing a spectrum. The default value is
1.</li>

<li>
<code>--max-charge &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the maximum charge
state to look for when analyzing a spectrum. The default value is
3.</li>

<li>
<code>--corr &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the correlation
threshold to accept a predicted isotope distribution. Valid values are
any decimal value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The default value is
0.90.</li>

<li>
<code>--depth &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the depth of
combinatorial analysis. This is the maximum number of protein or
peptide distributions that can be combined to estimate the observed
data at any given spectrum segment. The default value is 3.</li>

<li>
<code>--hardklor-dat &lt;Hardkl&ouml;r DAT file&gt;</code> &ndash;
Provide the full path and file name of the Hardkl&ouml;r data file
(typically Hardklor.dat) to be used in the analysis. This flag must be
set globally at the top of a config file if the data file to be used
is not in the working directory. (FIXME: Fix issue described in the
previous sentence.)</li>

<li>
<code>--intersection T|F</code> &ndash; When set to true, set peak
detection to intersection mode. Spectra are analyzed for peaks in
overlapping segments. When intersection mode is set, peaks are only
accepted if they appear in two overlapping segments. Default = T.</li>

<li>
<code>--mod &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; Include alternative
averagine models in the analysis that incorporate additional atoms or
isotopic enrichments. Modifications are represented as text
strings. Inclusion of additional atoms in the model is done using by
entering an atomic formula such as "PO2" or "Cl". Inclusion of
isotopic enrichment to the model is done by specifying the percent
enrichment (as a decimal) followed by the atom being enriched and an
index of the isotope. For example, 0.75H1 specifies 75% enrichment of
the first heavy isotope of hydrogen. In other words, 75% deuterium
enrichment. Two or more modifications can be combined into the same
model and separated by spaces: "B2 0.5B1". This parameter can also be
used redundantly to include multiple alternative averagine models in a
single analysis.</li>

<li>
<code>--mercury-dat &lt;Mercury DAT file&gt;</code> &ndash; Provide
the full path and file name of the Mercury data file (typically
ISOTOPE.DAT) to be used in the analysis.</li>

<li>
<code>--mzxml-filter MS1|MS2|MS2|none</code> &ndash; Set a filter for
mzXML files. If you want to analyze only the MS2 scans in your mzXML
file, specify <code>--mzxml-filter MS2</code>.  Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--no-base T|F</code> &ndash; Specify "no base" averagine. Only
modified averagine models will be used in the analysis. Default =
F.</li>

<li>
<code>--max-p &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the maximum number of
peptides or proteins that are estimated from the peaks found in a
spectrum segment. The default value is 10.</li>

<li>
<code>--resolution &lt;double&gt; fticr|orbi|tof|qit</code> &ndash;
Set the resolution of the observed spectra at m/z 400. The user must
specify a resolution followed by a mass spectrometer code. Valid codes
are fticr, orbi, tof, and qit. The default settings are 100000
fticr.</li>

<li>
<code>--smooth &lt;int&gt;</code> &ndash; Apply polynomial
Savitsky-Golay smoothing of the mass spectra prior to analysis. The
integer supplied with the flag sets the width of the smoothing
window. A larger width makes smoother peaks, but has more alteration
of peak intensity. By default there is no smoothing.</li>

<li>
<code>--scan-number &lt;number range&gt;</code> &ndash; A single scan
number or a range of numbers to be analyzed. Range should be specified
as 'first-last' which will include scans 'first' and 'last'.  Default
= search all spectra.</li>

<li>
<code>--sensitivity 0|1|2|3</code> &ndash; Set the sensitivity
level. There are four levels, 0 (low), 1 (moderate), 2 (high), and 3
(max). Increasing the sensitivity may increase computation time. The
default value is 1.</li>

<li>
<code>--signal-to-noise &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the
signal-to-noise threshold. Any integer or decimal value greater than
or equal to 0.0 is valid. The default value is 3.0.</li>

<li>
<code>--sn-window &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the signal-to-noise
window length (in m/z). Because noise may be non-uniform across a
spectra, this value adjusts the segment size considered when
calculating a signal-over-noise ratio. The default value is 50.0.</li>

<li>
<code>--union-mode T|F</code> &ndash; Set peak detection to union
mode. Spectra are analyzed for peaks in overlapping segments. When
union mode is set, peaks are accepted regardless of whether they
appear in one segment or two overlapping segments. Default = F.</li>

<li>
<code>--mz-window &lt;double&gt; &lt;double&gt;</code> &ndash; Restrict
analysis to only a small window in each segment (in m/z). The user
must specify the starting and ending m/z values between which the
analysis will be performed. By default the whole spectrum is
analyzed.</li>

<li>
<code>--max-width &lt;float&gt;</code> &ndash; Set the maximum width
of any set of peaks in a spectrum when computing the results (in
m/z). Thus, if the value was 5.0, then sets of peaks greater than 5
m/z are divided into smaller sets prior to analysis. The default value
is 5.0.</li>

<li>
<code>--parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; A file
containing command-line or additional parameters.  See
the <a href="parameter-file.html">parameter documentation</a> page for
details.  Default = no parameter file.</li>

<li>
<code>--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;</code> &ndash; 
Specify the verbosity of the current processes. Each level prints the
following messages, including all those at lower verbosity levels:
0-fatal errors, 10-non-fatal errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on
the progress of execution, 40-more progress information, 50-debug
info, 60-detailed debug info. Default = 30.</li>
