@@ It would be nice if configuration happens only when it is 
   required. For example if I need to build something that 
   uses CORBA then only in this case happens configuration of
   CORBA facilities.


@@ 'configure' should depend on 'clean'


@@ What if I change something in config file (let's say archive to shared)
   and then say make - things will break.


@@ It would be nice if I could keep build/ outside of the project. This
   is going to be very useful when multiple projects share the same
   build system.

@@ it would be nice to have a project_base which will be 
   $(root)/example/project. However, in normal most cases project will be 
   the same as root, right? Look at CCF. Some comments:
   
   Saying -I$(root) would be exactly what I need if its value would be
   .../example/project. This, according to the concept of clusters, could
   be achived if I make .../example/project a cluster (which is quite 
   natural thing to do). It would also be a good example of a cluster. 


@@ Right now I have one global implicit rule for the project. In most
   cases this is probably enough. But what if I want to use different
   rules for different sub-projects (config clusters). For example two
   parts of the same project could use different compilers or ORB or...
   Probably the generic approach would be to provide sub-dir specific
   rules.

@@ concept of configuration clusters (no more src_root).


@@ Can I get rid of src_root and out_root (i.e. can they be /)?


@@ It would be nice if I could configure the same sub-system
   (like CORBA) for dirrefent parts of the project differenty.


@@ Do I really need those configuration clusters? Is the structure
   of CCF right? Or am I just trying to hide problems of wrong
   structuring? Isn't it overcomplication? Even if not shouldn't
   I postpone this until I gain more experience?
