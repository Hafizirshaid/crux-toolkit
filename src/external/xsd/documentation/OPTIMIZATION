%% I should keep a separate list of files that are included-once which
   should also cache the realpaths.

@@ It would make sense to use $(call include-once,out_dir) in cxx/cxx-o.make
   etc.

@@ Need to check what is being framed.

@@ Make executes each line in a separate shell. I wonder if using && is

@@ Look for redundant $(eval ) calls (like I had in include-*).

@@ use head -n 1 instead of sed -e 1q
