Prerequisites

    - GNU make >= 3.81    http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
    - GNU bash >= 2.05a   http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/


Installing the build system

  To install the build system you can execute the following command 
  in the root directory of the source distribution:

  $ make install

  If you want to install it to a different location (default is 
  /usr/local) you can do

  $ make install_prefix=/usr install

  Note that you need to install the build runtime into a place where GNU 
  make will look by default (normally /usr/include and /usr/local/include).
  Alternatively, you can install it into some other place (for example, 
  your home directory) and set MAKEFLAGS accordingly:

  $ make install install_prefix=/home/user/local
  $ export MAKEFLAGS="-I /home/user/local/include"


Building examples

  There is a makefile accompanying each example. Running 'make' usually 
  does the trick. Note that running 'make install' in an example directory
  will install what the example has built as opposed to installing the 
  example source code.
