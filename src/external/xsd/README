build is a massively-parallel software build system implemented on top of 
GNU make. Build is designed with the following tasks in mind:

    * configuration
    * building
    * testing
    * installation

Some of its features include:

    * position-independent makefiles

    * non-recursive multi-makefile include-based structure

    * leaf makefiles are full-fledged GNU makefiles, not just variable
      definitions

    * complete dependency graph

    * inter-project dependency tracking

    * extensible language/compiler framework
